# TOP-Cuidado
An mobile app that tracks and manages mental health for youths in Puerto Rico

## Overview
This project was created thanks to the awareness raised by the people of The Opportunity Project and advanced with the objective of Enhancing Childrenâ€™s Resilience in Puerto Rico. We chose to resolve this problem by Nurturing Positive Mental Reinforcement practices and attitudes in the youth of Puerto Rico. Our method of choice is our mobile application "Cuidado" with mental health support as its main objective while also being used for educational purposes.
